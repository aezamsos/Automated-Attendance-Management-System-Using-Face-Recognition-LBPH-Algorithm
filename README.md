# Automated-Attendance-Management-System-Using-Face-Recognition-LBPH-Algorithm
The "Automated Attendance Management System Using Face Recognition (LBPH Algorithm)" automates attendance tracking through facial recognition. It employs the LBPH algorithm for accurate identification, replacing manual methods with efficient, reliable automation.

Automated Attendance Management System (AMS)
Overview
This project implements an Automated Attendance Management System using Python. The system utilizes facial recognition technology (LBPH Algorithm) for attendance tracking. 
It integrates with databases like Oracle 19c or 21c and
Requires Windows 10 with a minimum of 8GB RAM.

Prerequisites - Just Follow The Steps:
Create Folder Name Called "TrainingImages" in Project Folder.
Ensure the following libraries are installed:

tkinter
cv2 (OpenCV)
numpy
PIL (Pillow)
pandas
pymysql
Installation Steps
Install Python on your system.
Install the required libraries using pip:
bash
Copy code
pip install numpy opencv-python pillow pandas pymysql
Ensure Oracle 19c or 21c is installed and accessible.
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Configuration
Replace file paths as necessary in AMS_RUN.py to match your directory structure.
Running the System
Navigate to the directory containing AMS_RUN.py.
Execute the following command to run the system:
bash
Copy code
python AMS_RUN.py
Usage
Upon running AMS_RUN.py, the system will initiate the attendance tracking interface.
Follow on-screen instructions to capture and recognize faces for attendance purposes.
Attendance data will be stored in the connected database.
